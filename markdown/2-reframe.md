## Step 2 - The reframe
- Well prepared insights
- Catch customer off guard with unexpected viewpoint
- Looking for 'I never thought of it that way' response
- This needs to teach the customer something new - not something they have already considered solutions for - define the next RFP
- Do not be timid - surprise the customer
