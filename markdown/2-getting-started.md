## Spring MVC

- Model
- View
- Controller

Notes:
- The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern
- three main components: the model, the view, and the controller.
- Model
- Model is responsible for managing the data of the application.
- It includes the logic for storing and manipulating data
- as well as the rules for how that data can be accessed and modified.
- View
- Responsible for presenting the data to the user.
- Graphics, text, images, and forms etc.
- Controller
- Responsible for handling user input and interactions.
- It receives requests from the view
- processes them using the model
- and then updates the view as needed.
- The pattern
- Helps to divide the complexity of an application
- into smaller, more manageable pieces
- makes it easier to develop, maintain, and test the application.
